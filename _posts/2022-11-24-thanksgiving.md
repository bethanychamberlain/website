### Valuable...
- I have found it very valuable this week to focus on what was most motivating/inspiring. There are not a lot of jobs that have varied enough tasks or inherent flexibility to enable that. By stepping outside of myself and the stress I often feel, I feel like I can see more objectively how cool of an opportunity it is to "do research" and that makes me feel pretty happy. This reflection might also be inspired by the natural "thanksgiving" thought processes of trying to see everything thru a positive lens. There's toxic positivity, of course, and I don't want to fall into that trap, but I don't think I am. I have areas I want to improve, but I am in the unique position (in general in life, but also in this job/in this lab/at this university) to improve and learn, and that's something I don't want to take for granted. It's not a given we will always be in positions that enable personal growth, so I want to enjoy it more, or at least value it more consciously.

#### Who did you help this week?
- Not a lot of people! I helped my cats more than anyone this week.
- I met with the masters students for their project update and tried to give some helpful tips for analyzing datasets. I also sent them a couple of literature examples to inspire them for how they organize their results visually in tables.
- I generally find that helping the masters students helps me. I don't know if it's the "learning by teaching" axiom, but it's definitely something I have noticed this semester whether it's a way of thinking of things, a specific piece of literature, positive reinforcement/motivation, and more. The way I help them ends up (tangibly or not) helping me, and I love that. Maybe this should also go in the valuable section.

#### Who helped you this week?
- Perhaps unknowingly, but my masters students.
- VC helped by telling me how she does the latex todo command. This has been something that has actively confounded me and I just kept forgetting to ask.
- An ITU employee who has given me information relating to incentives for research participants and is looking up information for me this week so that I can feel confident I am saying the right thing to participants who we will give gifts. I worry about being annoying sometimes, but whenever I reach out to anyone at ITU, they are always so helpful and try to get me answers or get me to someone who can. I might wish certain answers were simply logged somewhere or shared on the ABC, but if that's not the case, I will definitely take friendly and helpful colleagues!

#### What did you achieve?
- I spent more time "immersing" myself in the data. I was doing some exploration, some analyses, etc. I think it felt better this week as I have done more reading/writing/note-taking since the last time I did a deep dive into the data. I felt like I was able to see more potential discussion spots. That felt pretty inspiring and I am actually in a better emotional spot than I have been for a while with respect to *wanting* to sit down and write. I didn't think I would have a hard time putting aside the writing/my computer for my thanksgiving break, but of course annoyingly the brain is such a contrarion and I do feel like writing/have ideas. I hope the rest from the holiday paired with that motivation makes the weeks until winter holidays positively productive.
- I did, for the most part, leave work at a good time yesterday because I had to make my date with AV, which was an important personal commitment.

#### What did you struggle with?
- I struggled with life getting in the way of goals. I struggle a lot with the negative self-talk that happens when I set goals and for whatever reason that doesn't happen. I like setting realistic goals, it can be really helpful, and if I don't make that goal because I actually ended up working on some other equally important goal, I might be upset with myself but I can usually accept it/rationalize it and move on. But if the goal isn't met purely because of some other nonsense or even genuine health/personal issues, the negative self-talk kicks up and just goes on and on and on.
- So I guess I also struggled with myself?
- But definitely also the cats. They had their vet appointment on Monday and I thought AV would be able to take them, but he couldn't so then it was up to me. Then one mystery cat started peeing on things this weekend/Monday which has been so annoying and stressful because I was worried about one of them being sick (since I also found a little puke) and also needing to clean hard-to-clean items.
- Oh, and my glasses. I woke up Tuesday morning and broke my glasses before I even got out of bed. I've been procastinating going to get the eye test that I am overdue for (was going to write because, but there has been no good reason). So I made the appointment so that I could get these glasses fixed at the same time. It took so much longer than I expected, but I guess I'm glad I went because my prescription has changed a bit and the new glasses will help more with reading, a thing I kiiiiinda do a lot. So, this was an annoying struggle that got in the way of my plan for uninterupted focusing on Tuesday.

#### What would you like to work on next week?
- I want to finish visualizing the data on the whiteboard. I got a nice start, but I want to incorporate salient quotes from the interviews and I want to highlight some info from the conference websites. The visualizing helps "see the story" and also focuses the data I am using because there's only so much space; you have to choose carefully.
- I want to finish the GDPR online module; teaching philosophy with Dovile; and take a look at the yearly development meeting framework for meeting SF soon.
- I want to finish writing up the introduction and methods of the paper based on the notes I have. While that's my goal, I realize I might find that I am more inspired/motivated to finish writing the methods and findings. That would also be great!


#### Commitment to Self
- Other than the fact that I am writing this the morning of thanksgiving because I didn't get to it before leaving for my date night... I will not work over the thanksgiving holiday. Nothing is so imperative that I cannot afford to actually take time off and enjoy cooking, video chatting with friends and family, and puttering around the house.
