Hello, my name is Bethany and I think it's really weird but cool that you've somehow landed on this website! Welcome!

I am a 1st year PhD Fellow at the IT University of Copenhagen in Denmark. I have a background in psychology and am sitting in the computer science department (associated with PURRLab & DASYA). Broadly speaking, my research is focused on the decision-making processes of AI/ML researchers. I am exploring or planning to explore themes such as human bias, ethics, self-auditing of workflows, perceptions, similarity, and more.

I am also an external lecturer for DIS Study Abroad in Denmark, teaching their **Public Mental Health** course to undergraduate American students.

In my "free" time, I like going for walks, hanging out with my cats and husband, playing games (card, board, video), and I love to read. I host a monthly book club at Books & Company in Hellerup.

This website is very new and very much under development, so consider visiting again later.
