Hello, my name is Bethany and I think it's really weird but cool that you've somehow landed on this website! Welcome!

I am currently in a transitional phase as I have recently chosen to leave my PhD program as of March 2023. During my time as a PhD fellow, however, my love for the research process has only grown stronger, and I am eager to apply and strengthen my skills in familiar and/or new areas.

As a student, researcher, and lecturer, I have gone down many, many rabbit holes. Some of the topics I have spent the most time researching and thinking about include:

- Public mental health
    - Diagnosis, treatment, advocacy
    - Social model of disability, strengths-based approaches
    - Nature therapy, forest bathing
    - Developmental psychopathology
    - Global events (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic)
    - Accommodations (e.g., work, school, relationships)
- Thinking and decision-making, heuristics and biases
    - The role of unconscious bias in everyday life and decision-making
- Diversity, inclusivity, equity
- Interdisciplinarity, epistemological differences
- Technology in education for the benefit of students and teachers


Unchanged during this transitional time, I am an external lecturer for DIS Study Abroad in Denmark, teaching their **Public Mental Health** course to undergraduate American students in the Fall and Spring semesters. As an external lecturer with DIS, there are other topics I have taught/will teach, either as the primary lecturer, guest lecturer, and/or workshop facilitator. With this organization, I have prioritized improving my pedagogical competencies; trying new classroom technologies; thinking creatively about effective teaching and learning; and using research to inform the foundation of each lecture.

During this transitional time, I am embracing some work-life balance that I have been lacking. This includes learning about sustainable home gardening to prepare for the upcoming growing season; going for walks and exploring new neighborhoods; playing interesting and puzzling games (I solved my first Rubik's cube!); and reading. Since 2019, I have hosted a monthly book club with the wonderful support of Books & Company in Hellerup, so you can imagine the stack of books I am always pretending I will get through.

This website is very much under development, so consider visiting again later. Until then, feel free to email me or reach out via LinkedIn if you think I could contribute to a project you're working on or to have me give a guest lecture/facilitate a workshop.
