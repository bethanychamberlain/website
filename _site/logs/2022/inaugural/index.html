<meta name="description" content="Valuable… It has been really valuable thinking about how inclusivity can be implemented in organizations, but also how even with all the good intentions and statements or documents supporting the idea, it can still fail to take off / succeed / positively impact individuals. I especially love the idea of epistemic inclusivity where we want to move beyond the most salient diverse identities and include differents ways of thinking, too. It’s just so obviously connected to everything, from comparing one thing to another, having a conversation, judging an image, writing an email. Everything! Realizing this both theoretically from various readings and also feeling this as I confront different backgrounds, fields, communication styles, etc makes for a very comprehensive understanding of the concept(s). I have been particularly reflective about this last year as we get to the end of it and from conversations with others (AV, HJ, BW). I could never have guessed some of the topics I might be interested in at the beginning of this year, let alone how much I would learn about the general ML/AI field with respect to ethical considerations, current topics, and more. Someone just today was saying something along the lines of: it’s not always about learning to use a specific tool, sometimes the important outcome is learning to be more reflective about (e.g.,) your use of that tool (and others). I like this framing applied to the research/phd process. It can be stressful reflecting on how things didn’t go as smoothly as I hoped, but I want to do better at focusing on/valuing the fact that if I am thinking about how I could have done something better, then I learned something for next time. Who did you help this week? I helped the students I am supervising for their masters project with some ideas and signposting for NVivo analysis. I also got a nice thank you from them for helping clean up the Overleaf document they started which I thought was a weirdly fast full circle since I really needed help with that from VC. That I could so quickly pass on that help and see that it really helped them get started was cool. I helped give advice to AJS on visualizations for one of her papers - a tiny help but a fun thing to help with. Who helped you this week? I got help/feedback from VC on some questions I had about the draft-draft I am working on. Sometimes I don’t have an intuition about a yes or no from something, so it’s nice to take into consideration someone else’s intuition. My new “coach” (HJ) from my municipality helped me a lot already and I am looking forward to working with her for the next few months. Taylor Swift by releasing her Midnights album in time for me to use for writing sessions, which I know she did specifically for me. Thanks, Taylor. What did you achieve? I completed what I think is the last interview for the HelloStar project and it made me really happy to end the data collection on a high note. I successfully made the final edits to my personal/academic website (where this is published!) and I am really proud of what I was able to learn and apply in a pretty short space of time when it comes to jekyll/ruby/basic coding for websites. I have managed to stop biting my nails for almost a week. What did you struggle with? I struggled/am struggling with writing the introduction to the current paper. I don’t know why this section more than any other stresses me out so much. I feel frozen sometimes and I have the most issues with bad thought patterns whenever I focus on it. What would you like to work on next week? Next week is a short week because of the Thanksgiving vacation so my goals are simple (with the complication just being getting them done) Submit as complete a draft as humanly possible by 16:00 on Wednesday. Give feedback to masters students during our Wednesday meeting and signpost them to resources that are relevant for the work they’ll be doing when I am on holiday. Work with DJ for an hour or two on PhD-related stuff to get off our to-do lists. Commitment to Self My work will be set aside no later than 17:00 next Wednesday. I have a date night planned for that evening as an early holiday gift and I have calls planned with friends and family back home. I have plans to enjoy a special Thanksgiving lunch with a couple of friends. I have household DIY tasks I am looking forward to completing. Whatever I have done on Wednesday is enough and I will not work over the holiday break. Making time to rest, prioritizing family, investing effort into our new house — these make me a happier person and, as a bonus, a more productive worker bee. Buzzzzzz." />
