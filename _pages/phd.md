### Note, March 2023 ###

I have chosen to transition away from academia and will not be finishing this PhD program.


### Short Description ###


I focus on how artificial intelligence researchers **do** research, primarily with respect to machine learning. *Doing* research includes, for example, choosing conferences to attend, comparing/contrasting datasets during model training, and teaching research processes. Importantly, the project highlights decisions that are critical yet unconscious. By adopting methods from psychology, computer science, philosophy, and other relevant fields, the interdisciplinary nature of the project invites diverse stakeholders to participate and/or contribute. This increases the opportunity for generalization/broad application of the results, while also decreasing issues of bias that can arise from investigating an important topic through a single lens.
