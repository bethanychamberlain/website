### Responsibilities ###

I am the sole lecturer for this course and responsible for booking field studies and guest lectures.


### Course Description ###

In this course, we explore the different challenges faced by those with mental health conditions compared to physical health problems. Using peer-reviewed literature, white papers, popular media, and discussions with experts in academia and Danish Industry, students develop the necessary competencies that enable them to make a positive difference as future leaders promoting healthy populations. The core teaching method for this course is based on collaboration -- collaboration between students but also between teacher and student(s). Class discussions and group work are used to help students develop and practice skills relating to the peer review process, giving effective presentations, tailoring messages and targeting appropriate audiences, and more. Where possible, students have the freedom to tailor assignments according to their academic background or personal interest.
